    We try to design a new document exchange system that will be compatible
    with other existing systems.

    The main document lifecycle is:
        1. creation 
        2. sending
        3. signature by all parties involved
    The system will not recognize any order of signatures and requires only that all signatures existing
    If there are all signatures for the document, the document is considered complete
)
service newSystem {
    persistent agreements = [
        {
            id : 1,
            correspondents : [ "111", "222" ]
        }
    ];

    persistent correspondents = {
        "111" : newSystem,
        "222" : oldSystem
    };

    routes {
        "/create" -> create
        "/send" -> send // send the document to correspondents
        "/sign" -> sign  // sign certain fields of the document (number, title, attachments) and send the signature
        "/decline" -> decline // sign the declination and send the signature
        "/retract" -> retract // sign the retraction and send the signature

        "/ext/create" -> extCreate // received sent document
        "/ext/sign" -> extSign // 
        "/ext/decline" -> extDecline
        "/ext/retract" -> extRetract
    }
}

--- (
    Old system is an existing systemof document exchange.
    The document lifecycle is similar to the new one, however
    there is a special option for signatures. User may specify
    a strict order of signatures, so that every party must wait
    for others that must sign before them. If one party signs the
    document out of order, the the system accepts the signature,
    but it is not valid.
)
service oldSystem {
    persistent agreements = [];

    routes {
        "/create" -> create
        "/sign" -> approve
        "/decline" -> decline

        "/ext/create" -> extCreate
        "/ext/sign" -> extSign
        "/ext/decline" -> extDecline
    }
}


--- (
    Property:
        If a document in an end state (done, declined, retracted) at some system,
        eventually the document must be in that same state in every other system.

        If there is an invalid signature for a document, eventually every other
        system must mark this signature as invalid.

        If someone retracts the documents, it must always remain retracted.
